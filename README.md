## 📦 Instructions

### ✅ Step 1: Create the Product Dictionary

- Define a `Dictionary<int, Product>` where:
  - `int` is the ProductID
  - `Product` is a class or struct that contains `Name` and `Price`

- Add **at least 10 products** to your inventory. Example:

```csharp
ProductID = 101, Name = "Laptop", Price = R5000  
ProductID = 102, Name = "JBL Speaker", Price = R8000  
ProductID = 103, Name = "Tablet", Price = R2300  
// Add/Edit more depending on your preference
